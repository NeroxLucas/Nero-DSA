/*
given an array as follows:
X = [10, 30, 4, 51, 13, 8, 90]
binary search tree is used to store the array numbers. draw the tree structure for this array :
note: the following format can be used to design your tree in the text file, where you can replace A, B, ... G with the array numbers 
                                                A
                                B                           C
                    D                   E               F       G
 

once we have obtained the BST for X, we want to visit all node in this tree. if we use the following algo, show the reuslt
    + Recursively visit the right child node
    + Recursively visit the left child node
    + visit a node and display its value 

DO NOT IMPLEMENT THIS CODE IN C
